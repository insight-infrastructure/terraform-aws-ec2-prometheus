      description: This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline
        is functional. This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing
        in Alertmanager and always fire against a receiver. There are integrations with
        various notification mechanisms that send a notification when this alert is
        not firing. For example the "DeadMansSnitch" integration in PagerDuty.
